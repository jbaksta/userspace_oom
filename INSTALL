You'll first need to setup a memory limited cgroup with the kernel 
oomkiller disabled. See the Linux cgroup documentation for details. 

Then see the included "build.sh" script for an example of how to build. 
You'll need to ensure that libcgroup (and headers) is available. 

Once you have a binary, copy it to an appropriate location on your system. 
"init.sh" is included as a sample RedHat (6) compatible style startup script
If you'd like to use it, you'll need to 
at least edit the "cg" variable with the name of the cgroup you'd like to 
monitor. 

For now, see "oomkiller.c" for a list of command line options
